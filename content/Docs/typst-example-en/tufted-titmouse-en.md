# The Tufted Titmouse

The tufted titmouse (*Baeolophus bicolor*) is a small, lively songbird native to the deciduous forests of eastern North America. Its distinctive features include a gray crest, large dark eyes, and rusty flanks. These birds are agile foragers and frequent visitors to backyard feeders. In winter, they often join mixed flocks with chickadees and nuthatches. Their clear, whistle-like call sounds like they are repeatedly singing "*peter-peter-peter*".

We can use the logistic growth equation to model their population dynamics:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = rP \left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)
$$

Where $P$ denotes the population size, $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate, and $K$ is the carrying capacity of the habitat.
